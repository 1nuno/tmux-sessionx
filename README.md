# Install üíª
Add this to your `.tmux.conf` and run `Ctrl-I` for TPM to install the plugin.
```conf
set -g @plugin 'omerxx/tmux-sessionx'
```

# Configure ‚öôÔ∏è
The default binding for this plugin is `<prefix>+O`
You can change it by adding this line with your desired key:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è
This was only tested on one, macOs machine.
It is also not designed to use outside Tmux and is tailored to fit *my* needs.
That said, please feel free to open issues with bugs / additions you'd like to see.
